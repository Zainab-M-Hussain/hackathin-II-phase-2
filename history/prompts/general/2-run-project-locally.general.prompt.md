## Prompt

do it by your self

## Response snapshot

I will proceed to run the backend and frontend components of the application. Please note that for the frontend, you will need to open a new terminal once the backend is running.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Initiated execution of backend and provided instructions for frontend.
- 🧪 Tests: No explicit tests run for this setup step.
- 📁 Files: Created PHR for this interaction.
- 🔁 Next prompts: Execution of backend commands, then frontend commands.
- 🧠 Reflection: User requested direct execution; provided initial steps for backend and informed about frontend needing a separate terminal.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A
